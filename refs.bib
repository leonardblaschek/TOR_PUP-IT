  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is of utmost importance for plant growth and development. Multiple studies have shown that N signaling is tightly coupled with carbon (C) levels, but the interplay between C/N metabolism and growth remains largely an enigma. Nonetheless, the protein kinases Sucrose Non-fermenting 1 (SNF1)-Related Kinase 1 (SnRK1) and Target Of Rapamycin (TOR), two ancient central metabolic regulators, are emerging as key integrators that link C/N status with growth. Despite their pivotal importance, the exact mechanisms behind the sensing of N status and its integration with C availability to drive metabolic decisions are largely unknown. Especially for SnRK1 it is not clear how this kinase responds to altered N levels. Therefore, we first monitored N-dependent SnRK1 kinase activity with an in vivo Separation of Phase-based Activity Reporter of Kinase (SPARK) sensor, revealing a contrasting N-dependency in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) shoot and root tissues. Next, using affinity purification (AP) and proximity labeling (PL) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) experiments, we constructed a comprehensive SnRK1 and TOR interactome in Arabidopsis cell cultures during N-starved and N-repleted growth conditions. To broaden our understanding of the N-specificity of the TOR/SnRK1 signaling events, the resulting network was compared to corresponding C-related networks, identifying a large number of novel, N-specific interactors. Moreover, through integration of N-dependent transcriptome and phosphoproteome data, we were able to pinpoint additional N-dependent network components, highlighting for instance SnRK1 regulatory proteins that might function at the crosstalk of C/N signaling. Finally, confirmation of known and identification of novel SnRK1 interactors, such as Inositol-Requiring 1 (IRE1A) and the RAB GTPase RAB18, indicate that SnRK1, present at the ER, is involved in N signaling and autophagy induction.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) defying the traditional protein structure--function paradigm have been difficult to analyze. The availability of accurate structure predictions on a large scale in AlphaFoldDB offers a fresh perspective on IDR prediction. Here, we establish three baselines for IDR prediction from AlphaFoldDB models based on the recent CAID dataset. Surprisingly, AlphaFoldDB is highly competitive for predicting both IDRs and conditionally folded binding regions, demonstrating the plasticity of the disorder to structure continuum.},

  abstract = {The relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of a residue in a protein measures the extent of burial or exposure of that residue in the 3D structure. RSA is frequently used to describe a protein's biophysical or evolutionary properties. To calculate RSA, a residue's solvent accessibility (ASA) needs to be normalized by a suitable reference value for the given amino acid; several normalization scales have previously been proposed. However, these scales do not provide tight upper bounds on ASA values frequently observed in empirical crystal structures. Instead, they underestimate the largest allowed ASA values, by up to 20\%. As a result, many empirical crystal structures contain residues that seem to have RSA values in excess of one. Here, we derive a new normalization scale that does provide a tight upper bound on observed ASA values. We pursue two complementary strategies, one based on extensive analysis of empirical structures and one based on systematic enumeration of biophysically allowed tripeptides. Both approaches yield congruent results that consistently exceed published values. We conclude that previously published ASA normalization values were too small, primarily because the conformations that maximize ASA had not been correctly identified. As an application of our results, we show that empirically derived hydrophobicity scales are sensitive to accurate RSA calculation, and we derive new hydrophobicity scales that show increased correlation with experimentally measured scales.},

  abstract = {The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is a conserved regulatory hub that translates environmental and nutritional information into permissive or restrictive growth decisions. Despite the increased appreciation of the essential role of the TOR complex in plants, no large-scale phosphoproteomics or interactomics studies have been performed to map TOR signalling events in plants. To fill this gap, we combined a systematic phosphoproteomics screen with a targeted protein complex analysis in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Integration of the phosphoproteome and protein complex data on the one hand shows that both methods reveal complementary subspaces of the plant TOR signalling network, enabling proteome-wide discovery of both upstream and downstream network components. On the other hand, the overlap between both data sets reveals a set of candidate direct TOR substrates. The integrated network embeds both evolutionarily-conserved and plant-specific TOR signalling components, uncovering an intriguing complex interplay with protein synthesis. Overall, the network provides a rich data set to start addressing fundamental questions about how TOR controls key processes in plants, such as autophagy, auxin signalling, chloroplast development, lipid metabolism, nucleotide biosynthesis, protein translation or senescence.},
